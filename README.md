# Public-Data-Hack
A simple oldschool hack that uses forms or sign ups that accepts links for input. The organization's confirmation is sent to victims email, with a link to a malicious website. Theory is: if it is a legitimate website, the victim will likely click on it. Some creativity is involved. A quasi Cross site script.
